### Trend Summary

The metrics show a concerning shift toward disorder and internal stress. Project chaos has doubled (+4) along with a significant spike in anxiety (+4), while self-development time has been cut in half (-3). Though external pressures like unmet requests and outside stress have decreased, the internal work environment has become substantially more chaotic and anxiety-inducing.

### Reflex Actions

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**
- **Sleep Recovery Plan** - Sleep quality remains critically low (≤4)
- **Anti-Chaos Routine** including Pull-Request Chaos Protocol - Project chaos has reached 6 (≥6 threshold)
- **Self-Authorization Rule** - Jira autonomy at 4 (≤4 threshold)  
- **Daily Deep-Work Anchor** - Quiet work blocks at 2 (≤3 threshold)

**DELIVERY LOG RECOMMENDED:**
Given that Project Chaos (6) and Anxiety (7) are both ≥6, recommend using delivery_log.md to track and manage workload systematically.
